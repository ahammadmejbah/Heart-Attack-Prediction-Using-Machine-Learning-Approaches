# Heart-Attack-Prediction-Using-Machine-Learning-Approaches
Improving people's ability to detect the early warning signals of a heart attack is one of the most important factors in the process of reducing death rates throughout the world. The study of the clinical data takes into account a very important condition known as cardiovascular disease. When it comes to making an accurate forecast, this condition is one of the most important factors that needs to be taken into consideration first. It has the potential to be of tremendous use to medical practitioners to be able to forecast heart attacks using data science and machine learning (ML). It is feasible to take into account a number of different risk variables all at once while conducting an investigation of this kind. Diabetes, high blood pressure, and irregular pulse rhythms are just examples of the risk factors that might contribute to heart disease. The purpose of this study is to improve the accuracy of diagnosis for cardiac illnesses via the use of machine learning to its greatest potential and to its fullest potential.
